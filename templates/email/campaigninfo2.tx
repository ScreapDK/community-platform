<p>Hi from DuckDuckGo!</p>

<p>We wanted to check in and find out how you are coming along with helping your friends and family take back their privacy. Feel free to reply and let us know if you are running into any issues.</p>

<p>To help people make the switch to DuckDuckGo, we've found it works best to:
<ul>
<li>Set their default search engine to DuckDuckGo on all their browsers (including mobile).</li>
<li>Show them cool features like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">!bangs (!w for searching Wikipedia, !imdb for searching IMDB)</a>.
<li>Show them different <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/settings">themes and customization options</a>
<li>Cool Instant Answers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=green+day+songs&ia=audio">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=watch+rushmore&ia=watch">movies</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=people+in+space&ia=answer">people in space</a>. We now have <a href="https://duck.co/ia">hundreds of IAs built by our community</a>! </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Get them to commit trying DuckDuckGo for a week.</p>

<p>Thank you again for helping your friends and family take back their privacy. Your help really does make a difference.</p>
